# ATNLP-Assignment3

The assignment to present and discuss the previous experiment on writing and testing the transformer structure on three splits of the SCAN dataset. Further, implemented a pretrained T5 model using RAG and ICL to overcome systematicity issues. Results and discussion is presented in the pdf file.


All three notebooks that are divided by the three experiments. Experiment 1b is with the simple split, 2a is the length split without oracle and 2b is the length split with oracle.


## Running the experiments

All experiments were ran in google colab with the A100 hardware option to reduce the time between testing and test time.

All notebooks clone the SCAN repository and access them by opening the files.

### Experiment 2a & b

To run these experiments, the plot file must be accessible by the file system. In colab this means that just uploading the files will make it available.
This is only needed for the results and plot sections.
